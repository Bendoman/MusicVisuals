# Team member input 
This project was completed with collaboration from all team members. The majority of development was done together, in person on the same computer, hence the majority of commits coming from a single account. 

### Ben
I chose the song took care of modelling the cross and wrote the CrossVisual and TrumpetBandVisual classes. 
I am most proud of the 3D representation of the cross and having it sync up correctly with the beat. 
I learned the basics of 3D modeling in blender and how to work with audacity. 

### Caoimhin
I wrote the majority of the AudioBandsVisual and WaveForm classes.
I am most proud of phase 2 of the visualisation.
I learned about frequency bands and how to use them to syncronise visuals to music. 

### Evan
I wrote the CircularWaveVisual, craeted the piano buildup visualization near the end and collaborated with the rest. 
I am most proud of the piano buildup visualisation.
I learned how to use sin waves to create a circular waveform.
